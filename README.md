### Hi :)
I'm Kad, sometimes known as KadTheHunter, Kaddicus and most recently Kadalyst.

My primary projects are [NBT Library](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NBT-Library) (previously [The Shulker Archives](https://kadthehunter.github.io/ShulkerArchives/)), and my personal website [Shouting Into the Void](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/KadTheHunter.github.io). I also occasionally post new Python scripts in [Misc. Python Scripts](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/Misc-Python-Scripts).

I maintain a few Minecraft Java Fabric mods, such as [Accurate Block Placement: Reborn](https://github.com/hschwar/AccurateBlockPlacement-Reborn), [NoJumpDelay: Enhanced](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NoJumpDelay), and [QuickCoordsCopy: Enhanced](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/QuickCoordsCopy), and have contributed to the development of [Essence](https://github.com/LewMC/Essence), a modern replacement for EssentialsX, and [CreativeItemControl](https://github.com/Brokkonaut/Bukkit-CreativeItemControl), a plugin to limit and control NBT data on multiplayer servers.
