### Hi :)
I'm Kad, sometimes known as KadTheHunter, Kaddicus and most recently Kadalyst.

My primary projects are [The Shulker Archives](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/ShulkerArchives), and my personal website [Shouting Into the Void](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/KadTheHunter.github.io).

I also maintain a few Minecraft Java mods, such as [NoCreativeDrift](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NoCreativeDrift), [NoJumpDelay](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NoJumpDelay), and [QuickCoordsCopy](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/QuickCoordsCopy), and helped resurrect [Accurate Block Placement](https://github.com/hschwar/AccurateBlockPlacement-Reborn) from the dead before transferring it to [@hschwar](https://github.com/hschwar)
